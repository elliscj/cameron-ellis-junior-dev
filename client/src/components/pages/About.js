        My name is Cameron Ellis, I am an aspiring Software Developer based out
        of Denver CO. I have lived in the wonderful state of Colorado for my
        whole life and do not currently have any plans to leave, but will for
        the right oportunity. For the past 6 years I have worked as a Laser
        Technician for a company that makes laser engraving and cutting machines
        based out of Golden CO. This job was fun and rewarding for a time, but
        was not the career path I had hoped for, which has led me to looking for
        a new career in the field of Software Delvelopment. I am an extremely
        hard worker with an acute attention to detail and believe that you get
        out what you put in. My favorite hobbies are motorcycle travel and golf.
        Traveling and being imersed in the elements with just you and your
        machine is a very special feeling. My dream trip is to ride from Alaska
        to Ushuaia on the southern tip of Argentina. And my dog Amos III, I love
        my dog.
